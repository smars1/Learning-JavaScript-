    background-color: #eeeeee;
    color: #f00000
}
/* when we wanna select an id tag, we must do it with its name id but beginning with a # before,
like the following example when we called paragraph like #paragraph{}  */
#paragraph{
    color: #ff0000;
}

/* When we want to select a class can do it write the class name but with "."
before as in the following example with the tag class  */
